# python-todo
A Simple Todo App Created With Python, Flask and Flask SQLAlchemy(ORM).

## Reason Why I Made This

I wanted to be more familiar with how to create a simple app in Python and Flask. It is my first app in Python.

## Technical Difficulties:

I never written a full Python app before even a simple to do app. At first it was a bit confusing getting the app to run and print hello world but after playing around with it for a while, everything started to make more sense. Also It was my first time using Flask and Flask SQL. Thankfully I had SQL knowledge and used another ORM before Sequelize for PostgreSQL, It was not too bad picking up the concepts and syntax of SQLALchemy.
